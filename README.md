GoBoy is a multi-platform Nintendo GameBoy and GameBoy Color emulator written in go.
The emulator can run the majority of GB games and some CGB games. There is also
colour and sound support.
This emulator was primarily built as a development exercise and is still work in progress.
Please feel free to contribute if you're interested in GameBoy emulator development.

The program includes debugging functions making it useful for understanding the emulator operation for
building one yourself. These functions include printing of opcodes and register values to the console at each
step (although will greatly slow down the emulation) and toggling of individual sound channels.

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/Humpheh/goboy/cmd/goboy
```

## Building from Source
If you have go1.11:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Humpheh/goboy.git
cd goboy
go build -o goboy cmd/goboy/main.go
```

The program has been tested on MacOS and Windows 10, and is likely to work on Linux. Building on Windows 10
requires MinGW.

GoBoy uses the go library [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) for control binding and graphics rendering,
which requires OpenGL. You may need to install some requirements which can be found on the
[pixels readme](https://github.com/faiface/pixel#requirements).

On Linux, you'll need to install [gtk](https://www.gtk.org/download/linux.php).

## Usage 
```sh
goboy zelda.gb
```
Controls: <kbd>&larr;</kbd> <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> <kbd>&darr;</kbd> <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> <kbd>Backspace</kbd>

The colour palette can be cycled with <kbd>=</kbd> (in DMG mode), and the game can
be made fullscreen with <kbd>F</kbd>.


Other options:
```sh
  -dmg
    	set to force dmg mode
  -mute
    	mute sound output
```

Debug or experimental options:
```sh
  -cpuprofile string
    	write cpu profile to file (debugging)
  -disableVsync
    	set to disable vsync (debugging)
  -load string
    	location of save state to load (experimental)
  -stepthrough
    	step through opcodes (debugging)
  -unlocked
    	if to unlock the cpu speed (debugging)
```

### Debugging
There are a few keyboard shortcuts useful for debugging: 

<kbd>Q</kbd> - force toggle background<br/>
<kbd>W</kbd> - force toggle sprites<br/>
<kbd>A</kbd> - print gb background palette data (cgb)<br/>
<kbd>S</kbd> - print sprite palette data (cgb)<br/>
<kbd>D</kbd> - print background map to log<br/>
<kbd>E</kbd> - toggle opcode printing to console (will slow down execution)<br/>
<kbd>7,8,9,0</kbd> - toggle sound channels 1 through 4.

### Saving 
If the loaded rom supports a battery a `<rom-name>.sav` (e.g. `zelda.gb.sav`) file will be created
next to the loaded rom containing a dump of the RAM from the cartridge. A loop in the program will
update this save file every second while the game is running.

## Testing
GoBoy currently passes all of the tests in Blargg's `cpu_instrs` and `instr_timing` test roms.

These roms are included in the source code along with a test to check the output is as expected
(`instructions_test.go` and `timing_test.go`). These tests are also run on each commit.
