GoBoy is a multi-platform Nintendo GameBoy and GameBoy Color emulator written in go.
This emulator was primarily built as a development exercise, and while still 
work in progress it should run the majority of GB games, and some CGB games. There is also experimental
sound and colour support implemented.

The program includes debugging functions which make it useful for understanding how the emulator is working or
for building one yourself, such as a method for printing out opcodes and register values to the console at each
step. Turning these on will slow down the emulation.

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/Humpheh/goboy
```

The program has been tested on MacOS and Windows 10, and is likely to work on Linux. Building on Windows 10
requires MinGW.

GoBoy uses the go library [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) for control binding and graphics rendering,
which requires OpenGL. Instructions on installing them can be found on the
[pixels readme](https://github.com/faiface/pixel#requirements).

## Usage 
```sh
goboy -sound -cgb -rom zelda.gb
```
Controls: <kbd>&larr;</kbd> <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> <kbd>&darr;</kbd> <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> <kbd>Z</kbd> <kbd>X</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd> <kbd>Backspace</kbd>

The colour palette can be cycled with <kbd>=</kbd> (in DMG mode), and the game can
be made fullscreen with <kbd>F</kbd>.


Other options:
```sh
  -cgb
        set to enable cgb mode
  -cpuprofile string
        write cpu profile to file
  -disableVsync
        set to disable vsync
  -load string
        location of save state to load (experimental)
  -rom string
        location of rom file (required)
  -sound
        set to enable sound emulation (experimental)
  -stepthrough
        step through opcodes (debugging)
  -unlocked
        if to unlock the cpu speed (debugging)
```

### Debugging
There are a few keyboard shortcuts useful for debugging: 

<kbd>Q</kbd> - force toggle background<br/>
<kbd>W</kbd> - force toggle sprites<br/>
<kbd>A</kbd> - print gb background palette data (cgb)<br/>
<kbd>S</kbd> - print sprite palette data (cgb)<br/>
<kbd>D</kbd> - print background map to log<br/>
<kbd>E</kbd> - toggle opcode printing to console (will slow down execution)<br/>
<kbd>7,8,9,0</kbd> - toggle sound channels 1 through 4.

### Saving 
If the loaded rom supports a battery a `<rom-name>.sav` (e.g. `zelda.gb.sav`) file will be created
next to the loaded rom containing a dump of the RAM from the cartridge. A loop in the program will
update this save file every second while the game is running.

## Testing
GoBoy currently passes all of the tests in Blargg's `cpu_instrs` and `instr_timing` test roms.

These roms are included in the source code along with a test to check the output is as expected
(`instructions_test.go` and `timing_test.go`). These tests are also run on each commit.
